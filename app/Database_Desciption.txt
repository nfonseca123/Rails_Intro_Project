I will use the Faker gem to generate user data and regions for my database,
which will consist of two tables: users and regions. The users table will
store information such as email, first name, last name, phone number, and a
foreign key (region_id) linking each user to a region. The regions table will
contain seven predefined regions, each identified by an id and name. This setup
establishes a one-to-many relationship where multiple users can belong to a single region.
